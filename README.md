# Heart-Disease-Prediction
## Overview
This project involves building a machine-learning model using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data. The aim is to leverage patient data to assist healthcare professionals in early detection of heart conditions.

## Project Structure
* Dataset: The dataset includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle-related features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate.
* Modeling: A logistic regression model was developed for binary classification (presence or absence of heart disease).
* Evaluation: Model performance metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score were used to evaluate results.
## Results
* Model Performance Metrics
* Accuracy: 85%
* F1-Score: 83%
* ROC-AUC: 90%
